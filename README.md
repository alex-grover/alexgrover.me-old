Welcome to the repository for my personal website! It's very much a work in progress. Somehow I find myself spending more time rebuilding stuff than actually writing content ðŸ˜…

Technologies in use:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [Astro](https://astro.build)
- Markdown for content
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for hosting

## Getting Started

- Install Node.js
- Clone the repo
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`
